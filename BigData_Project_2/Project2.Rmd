This is an R Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. This code is used for the System setup. 

```{r}
#setwd("~/RData")
dataFile <- file.path("Project-2-Question/agaricus-lepiota.data")
```

Reading the values from the datasbase file from a CSV file.

```{r}
mushroomData <- read.table(dataFile, sep=",", header=FALSE)
```

Converting mushroomData into mushroomDataFrame to process the data further.

```{r}
mushroom.df = as.data.frame(mushroomData)
```

Adding column headers to make it more descriptive and adding meaning to the mushroom data.

```{r}
names(mushroom.df) <- c("class" , "cshape", "csurface", "ccolor", "bruises", "odor", "gattach", "gspace", "gsize", "gcolor", "sshape", "sroot", "ssabove", "ssbelow", "scabove", "scbelow", "vtype", "vcolor", "rnumber", "rtype", "spcolor", "popnum", "habitat")
mushroom.df
```

Remove Classification Column called "class" (1st attribute). It is the classification that is to be done and hence has no substantial information.

```{r}
classDF <- mushroom.df["class"]
drops <- c("class")
mushroom.df <- mushroom.df[ , !(names(mushroom.df) %in% drops)]
```

Saving the dataframe to share it with the group.

```{r}
save.image("RData/mushroomDF.RData")
load("RData/mushroomDF.RData")
```

Split the data frame into chunks of train and test database. The ideal ratio of dividing the data frame into train and test is subjective. So we use three different partition ratios for the sample size. This is for a 50-50 split.

```{r}
train_percentage <- 0.50
smp_size <- floor(train_percentage * nrow(mushroom.df))
set.seed(123)
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(mushroom.df)), size = smp_size)
train.df <- mushroom.df[train_ind, ]
test.df <- mushroom.df[-train_ind, ]
save.image("RData/Dataset/train_60.RData")
load("RData/Dataset/train_60.RData")
```

This is the 60-40 split. At any point the training data set can not be less than test database.

```{r}
train_percentage <- 0.60
smp_size <- floor(train_percentage * nrow(mushroom.df))
set.seed(123)
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(mushroom.df)), size = smp_size)
train.df <- mushroom.df[train_ind, ]
test.df <- mushroom.df[-train_ind, ]
save.image("RData/Dataset/train_60.RData")
load("RData/Dataset/train_60.RData")
```

And a 70-30 split.

```{r}
train_percentage <- 0.70
smp_size <- floor(train_percentage * nrow(mushroom.df))
set.seed(123)
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(mushroom.df)), size = smp_size)
train.df <- mushroom.df[train_ind, ]
test.df <- mushroom.df[-train_ind, ]
save.image("RData/Dataset/train_70.RData")
load("RData/Dataset/train_70.RData")
```

You can comment out any block to use the particular split. We will show results for 70-30 split.

```{r}

```
